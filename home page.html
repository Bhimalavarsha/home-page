    <p>Classical Indian Dance is a form of dance that originates from the classical periods of Indian culture. This type of dance is usually performed in classical music and typically features elaborate costumes, lavish sets, and dramatic movements.The classical dance forms that have developed in India all have set rules which have been followed traditionally over the years. This set of rules that the classical dances follow is called the Natya Shastra. This is the ancient text that all Indian classical dances obey by in order for them to be called a “classic”.</p><br>
